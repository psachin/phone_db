            System Properties page in Control Panel. This is especially useful 
            if you run a computer store and want your customers to be reminded

            <P>To add the manufacturer and support information you need to 
            create two new files in the Windows system directly, normally 
            "C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM" for Windows 95, 98 and Me and 
            "C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32" for Windows NT and 2000. 
            <P>The first file is a text file called "OEMINFO.INI". To create the 
            file open notepad and copy the template below, make any changes and 
            save the file in the System directory. 
            <P>OEMINFO.INI Template 
            <P><PRE>[General]
Manufacturer=Your Company, Inc.

[Support Information]
Line1=first line of support information
Line2=second line
Line3=third line
Line4=fourth line
...
LineN=nth line
; Create as many lines as you need by incrementing the Line number
</PRE>
            <P>The other file you need to create is a logo file. This is a 
            standard Windows bitmap file (172 x 172 pixels), saved as 
            "OEMLOGO.BMP" in the Windows System directory. 
            <P>Once you have created both these files open System Properties 
            from Control Panel and your company information and logo will be 
            displayed. The details you entered in the [Support Information] 
            section will show up when you click on the Support Information 
            button.</P>
            <P><I><B>Note:</B> To display a logo you must create a 172x172 
            (pixel) bitmap image and save it as OEMLOGO.BMP in the Windows 
            system directory.</I></P>
